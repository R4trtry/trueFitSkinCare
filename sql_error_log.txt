BuT I do have to say I ♡LOVE♡this BB cream. I honestly love it more then wearing foundation. I felt like it lasted longer, soaked Into my skin making it look like bare naked skin, flawless. Because even the best of foundations still looks like your wearing makeup. Idk how they do it but they did, it doesnt look like your wearing anything but at the same time it covers blemishes and un even skintone. I love this stuff. After trying it the first time, I was instantly hooked. I do recommend that u dont wear a thicker concealer. Wear a light weight one that still covers. I use giorgio armani maestro concealer and was perfect with this. Another thing I love about this is the price! Im not trying to spend the same amount of money or more on a BB cream instead of foundation. Thats just crazy. This is so affordable. Im shocked that all the beauty gurus aren''t obsessed with this as I am. I set it with kat von d lock it tattoo foundation. Compact powder lightly n its so gorgeous. This BB cream has great coverage, lightweight, flawless looking and matches my skin tone perfectly. Best stuff ever made. N side note : dont buy the $38 one. Just buy two instead if u want that amount and u save $2. Idk why they did that. Usually u get more at some kind of a discount.','P288804','2014-03-15',3,'0')

If you have dry skin you will feel like a different person. It will also take many years off your face just by the moisture bit retains and the texture changes your skin will benefit from. For dry skin I would use a very good powder such as Poudre-Compacte Radiance by YSL which you could apply underneath the eye and on the eye lid. This will prevent smudging of your mascara or flaking. If it does flake or if you make a mistake while applying yours mascara; since you have applied the powder underneath the eye to the top of the cheekbone just take a piece of tissue once it''s dried and gently wipe or flick it off. It will give your face a beautiful radiance. You always can apply this powder all over if you have dry skin as we''ll. if you have oily skin use a mattifying primer underneath(Matt Touch by YSL) the Bb Cream then the Poudre Compacte Radiance over your entire face. Alway no matter if dry or oily pat the powder in not wipe or sweep with a brush. Pat with the brush as we''ll. and always use a Beauty Blender for that sensational look of a Pro artist. Your BB Cream will look different and will be more beneficial for your skin! So, I hope I have helped everyone. This is my favorite line and everyone work toward VIB ROUGE!

I use it day and night. Great protection for my dry, sensitive outer skin barrier. My skin doesn''t feel dry anymore. It feels what I would think normal skin would feel. Leaves no greasy areas or dry areas. Balances out my skin completely. I use it as eye cream, too. I put this treatment on my ears (pixie cut), my neck (back &amp; front), behind the ears, chest and all exposed areas including hands - my hands and cuticles look great! It is an investment but a little goes a very long way! Wish they came out with one with SPF! I love Caudalie products in general - have never found anything that doesnt work! Have pretty much everything. If you don''t have much money all you need is this and an SPF! Totally change my life. By having added this to my Caudalie skincare I can really say my skin is now perfect. Oh, and it brightens without greasiness . Plus great over my Retin A!!!!! But I break out from anything and no dermatitis or breakout since. Skin is smooth as a baby''s! Good for every skin type - but get sample first and try for a few days. That''s what I did. Oily skin should definitely try it first. Looks like it would be heavy and great but amazingly absorbs into skin but you still get the benefits! Love it!!!!! And you can use with your other favorite skin products. Even mix a little with other creams or treatments - still works great. I would recommend this for women (and men) who don''t have time for a complicated skin care regimen or don''t want one can use this as their moisturizer/treatment/eyecream but want something that really works - this is it! Just remember to add an SPF during the day. Add it to any other skin care regiment you currently use and it will increase the efficacy of those products. Adore this product - can you tell!!!!!!!!!','P246528','2009-10-30',9,'1')

Well the salesgirl could tell I was irritated and was like come here, she grabbed my hand and walked me over to this. She told me to close my eyes and think happy thoughts. And then take deep breaths, and it was like a mojitio for the soul! I felt so much better. So much more relaxed. I love this stuff! I can''t live without it. Everyone I know gets mists in the face. I''ve hooked a few friends on it this way! It''s honestly the best middle of the day, I''m looking a lot tired, pick me up. I use it all day everyday. Honestly couldn''t live without it! The travel one stays in my makeup bag always. My only complaint is that I wish they made an Eco friendly refill for it. ❤️','P6025','2014-07-11',6,'0')

I use it day and night. Great protection for my dry, sensitive outer skin barrier. My skin doesn''t feel dry anymore. It feels what I would think normal skin would feel. Leaves no greasy areas or dry areas. Balances out my skin completely. I use it as eye cream, too. I put this treatment on my ears (pixie cut), my neck (back &amp; front), behind the ears, chest and all exposed areas including hands - my hands and cuticles look great! It is an investment but a little goes a very long way! Wish they came out with one with SPF! I love Caudalie products in general - have never found anything that doesnt work! Have pretty much everything. If you don''t have much money all you need is this and an SPF! Totally change my life. By having added this to my Caudalie skincare I can really say my skin is now perfect. Oh, and it brightens without greasiness . Plus great over my Retin A!!!!! But I break out from anything and no dermatitis or breakout since. Skin is smooth as a baby''s! Good for every skin type - but get sample first and try for a few days. That''s what I did. Oily skin should definitely try it first. Looks like it would be heavy and great but amazingly absorbs into skin but you still get the benefits! Love it!!!!! And you can use with your other favorite skin products. Even mix a little with other creams or treatments - still works great. I would recommend this for women (and men) who don''t have time for a complicated skin care regimen or don''t want one can use this as their moisturizer/treatment/eyecream but want something that really works - this is it! Just remember to add an SPF during the day. Add it to any other skin care regiment you currently use and it will increase the efficacy of those products. Adore this product - can you tell!!!!!!!!!','P246528','2009-10-30',9,'1')
